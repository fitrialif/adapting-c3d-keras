** DONE Create Summary of labels. 
   1. Write Script locally and test. 
      - For train01, not all the tools are used.
        
** TODO Load PIL or other image library
   1. For now, I am going to use Keras
   2. Pick one of the Keras Models under applications:
      - The fastest is probably the best choice
   3. Determine its input image size
   4. Reduce train01.mp4 to frames of that size
   5. Evalulate the model

** IN-PROGRESS +Pick a model that is already fine tuned for videos+
   Mostly finding models via ActivityNet 2017 tasks 3&4 submissions
   1. DenseNet
      - Not for videos... but killer for still images
      - TF Imps:
        - YixunaLi: NO weights, No finetuning
        - LaurentMazare: NO weights, NO finetuning
        - other one: No Weights...
   2. CDC: Convolutional-De-Convolutional Networks for Precise Temporal \
      Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos
      - Cited by winners of 2017, 
      - presented at CVPR 2017
      - Can only be used with Caffe, and even then:
        - Only with C3D, Facebooks improvement on Caffe for 3D convs
        - This will not build on my mac, as I do not have a gpu
        - It should work on aws
   3. Single SHot Temporal Action Detection
      - Tianwei Lin, Xu Zhao, Zheng Shou
   4. Temporal Convolution Based Action Proposal
      - Tianwei Lin, Xu Zhao, Zheng Shou
   5. arxiv prepint:1608.00797
   6. Segment-CNN
      - Another entry to CVPR 2016
      - Looks like it could be built for CPU based on config
      - Will attempt Build
      - Completed build, attempting Demo
      - Demo does not work right now, running make runtest to see if it was built right
      - =install_name_tool -change @rpath/libhdf5.10.dylib ~/anaconda2/lib/libhdf5.10.dylib .build_release/tools/caffe=
      - =install_name_tool -change @rpath/libhdf5_hl.10.dylib ~/anaconda2/lib/libhdf5_hl.10.dylib .build_release/tools/caffe=
      - And there was a huge crash with explosion, even with rebuilding and linking of CV
        - openMPI, Numpy, OpenBlas...
        - There involves opencv, so I will keep on eye on any other open cv errors
