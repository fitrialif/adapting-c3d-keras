** DONE Create Summary of labels. 
   1. Write Script locally and test. 
      - For train01, not all the tools are used.
        
** TODO Load PIL or other image library
   1. For now, I am going to use Keras
   2. Pick one of the Keras Models under applications:
      - The fastest is probably the best choice
   3. Determine its input image size
   4. Reduce train01.mp4 to frames of that size
   5. Evalulate the model

** IN-PROGRESS Pick a model that is already fine tuned for videos
   1. DenseNet
      - Not for videos...
      - TF Imps:
        - YixunaLi: NO weights, No finetuning
        - LaurentMazare: NO weights, NO finetuning
        - other one: No Weights...
   2. CDC: Convolutional-De-Convolutional Networks for Precise Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos
      - Won a temporal action compeition in 2017
      - 


** TODO Run a quick Keras Demo
