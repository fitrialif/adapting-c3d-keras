** DONE Create Summary of labels. 
   1. Write Script locally and test. 
      - For train01, not all the tools are used.
        
** TODO Load PIL or other image library
   1. For now, I am going to use Keras
   2. Pick one of the Keras Models under applications:
      - The fastest is probably the best choice
   3. Determine its input image size
   4. Reduce train01.mp4 to frames of that size
   5. Evalulate the model

** ABORTED +Pick a model that is already fine tuned for videos+
   Mostly finding models via ActivityNet 2017 tasks 3&4 submissions
   1. DenseNet
      - Not for videos... but killer for still images
      - TF Imps:
        - YixunaLi: NO weights, No finetuning
        - LaurentMazare: NO weights, NO finetuning
        - other one: No Weights...
   2. CDC: Convolutional-De-Convolutional Networks for Precise Temporal \
      Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos
      - Cited by winners of 2017, 
      - presented at CVPR 2017
      - Can only be used with Caffe, and even then:
        - Only with C3D, Facebooks improvement on Caffe for 3D convs
        - This will not build on my mac, as I do not have a gpu
        - It should work on aws
   3. Single SHot Temporal Action Detection
      - Tianwei Lin, Xu Zhao, Zheng Shou
   4. Temporal Convolution Based Action Proposal
      - Tianwei Lin, Xu Zhao, Zheng Shou
   5. arxiv prepint:1608.00797
   6. Segment-CNN
      - Another entry to CVPR 2016
      - Looks like it could be built for CPU based on config
      - Will attempt Build
      - Completed build, attempting Demo
      - Demo does not work right now, running make runtest to see if it was built right
      - =install_name_tool -change @rpath/libhdf5.10.dylib ~/anaconda2/lib/libhdf5.10.dylib .build_release/tools/caffe=

      - And there was a huge crash with explosion, even with rebuilding and linking of CV
        - openMPI, Numpy, OpenBlas...
        - There involves opencv, so I will keep on eye on any other open cv errors

** TODO In case ^ fails, I should begin looking for a simple seg-net in keras

** Review:
   - Yesterday, I did look at many interesting models, but none of them will
     work out of the box. Most would take quite a few hours simply to set up
     a develop envoirment, so I am putting them off till later
   - Off the top of my head, I feel that my options are to use slim or Keras

** DONE List Slim pros and Cons
   - PRO: I know it inside and out
   - PRO: video prediction model might work
       - https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/video_prediction
   - PRO: It is definately properly installed on my local


** DONE List Keras pros and Cons
   - CON: No video recognition models under Applications
   - PRO: Possibly C3D under model Zoo
     - https://github.com/albertomontesg/keras-model-zoo/blob/master/kerasmodelzoo/models/c3d.py


** WAITING pick slim or Keras
   - FAILED: goign with Keras and c3d in model zoo
   - Going to try harvitronix
   - Thgough harvitronix, found c3d-keras by axon-research
     - whihc is actually just one person...
     - Looks very promising.
     - Switching to AWS to speed things along...
   - WAITING FOR AWS TO LET ME HAVE A BLOODY INSTANCE

** IN-PROGRESS Train and Eval a First S***y Model
   - In leiu of AWS, I will try and get c3d-keras running locally
     - DONE Download weights 
     - DONE Download labels
     - DONE Download raw caffe model
     - DONE run protoc --python_out=. caffe.proto
     - DONE configure keras
     - DONE run convert_caffe_model
       - NOTE convert_caffe_model is not parralized and could be
     - DONE download test vids
     - WIP run test_model.py
       - cv2 is throwing errors, which is upsetting 
       - opencv is still not linked to homebrew...
       - but =pip install opencv-python= did the trick
   - Ok, so it works on the demo, but now I need to run with my stuff
   - 


** TODO TF throws warnings when running convert_caffe_model
   - If I am going to use c3d-keras, I should fix that.
   - I recorded the warnings in out.text
